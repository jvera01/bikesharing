In this module, you'll work with data visualization software called Tableau to present a business proposal for a bike-sharing company. First, you'll learn how to import, style, and portray data accurately. Then, you'll create worksheets, dashboards, and stories to visualize key data from a New York Citi Bike dataset.
What You Will Learn
By the end of this module, you will be able to:
•	Import data into Tableau.
•	Create and style worksheets, dashboards, and stories in Tableau.
•	Use Tableau worksheets to display data in a professional way.
•	Portray data accurately using Tableau dashboards.


Background
Now that we've gotten a good idea of how to create our story, there is still some more work to be done to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal. To solidify the proposal, one of the key stakeholders would like to see a bike trip analysis.

For this analysis, you’ll use Pandas to change the "tripduration" column from an integer to a datetime datatype. Then, using the converted datatype, you’ll create a set of visualizations to:

Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.
Finally, you’ll add these new visualizations to the two you created in this module for your final presentation and analysis to pitch to investors.

What You're Creating
This new assignment consists of two technical analysis deliverables and a written report to present your results. You will submit the following:

Deliverable 1: Change Trip Duration to a Datetime Format
Deliverable 2: Create Visualizations for the Trip Analysis
Deliverable 3: Create a Story and Report for the Final Presentation

Deliverable 1: Change Trip Duration to a Datetime Format (20 points)
Deliverable 1 Instructions
Using Python and Pandas functions, you’ll convert the "tripduration" column from an integer to a datetime datatype to get the time in hours, minutes, and seconds (00:00:00). After you convert the "tripduration" column to a datetime dataytpe, you’ll export the DataFrame as a CSV file to use for the trip analysis in Deliverable 2.

Deliverable 2: Create Visualizations for the Trip Analysis (50 points)
Deliverable 2 Instructions
Using Tableau, create visualizations that show:

How long bikes are checked out for all riders and genders.
How many trips are taken by the hour for each day of the week, for all riders and genders.
A breakdown of what days of the week a user might be more likely to check out a bike, by type of user and gender.


Follow the instructions below to complete Deliverable 2.

In Tableau, create a new Story using visualizations that will support the key findings you want to show.

You must use the five visualizations that you created in Deliverable 2.
You must use at least two visualizations that you created in this module.
In your README markdown file, include the following:
Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
Results: Using the visualizations you have in your Tableau Story, describe the results of each visualization underneath the image.
Summary: Provide a high-level summary of the results and two additional visualizations that you would perform with the given dataset.
